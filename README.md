> For project four, we are focusing on predictive maintenance for renewable energy systems. This project addresses critical challenges in the industry, the longevity of cutting-edge technology, and aims to contribute to a sustainable future. Our goal is to combine the practical benefits of cost savings and efficiency with the broader goal of supporting global renewable energy initiatives. This project was completed with the support of Peers, Stack Overflow, Google, AI, and Activities. 

Our research aims to address these key questions:

1. How can predictive maintenance contribute to renewable energy systems sustainability?

2. What trends can be identified in the cost production of turbine installation from historical data?

3. What is the optimal strategy for using classification models to identify failure points?

## Visualizations: Bar Chart, Data Results Output, Neural Network


* The **Bar Chart** shows **Costs** with a hover over tooltip details. The color gradients represent costs percentage and a chronological timeline of years. The higher the percentage the darker the color; the years are placed in a chronological order colored from light to dark.

* The **Data Trial Results** displays how a dataset can be fed into a model to correctly predict faulty sensor issues of wind turbines with 75% accuracy.

* Mock **Neural Network** Demo
